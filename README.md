# Simple random access memory design (4 Byte RAM)
This is a simple, Verilog implementation of the design of a 4-byte RAM, which was done as part of the final project in the Digital Design course, during my second year at BITS Goa. 

The problem statement was to design a 2 block 4 x 4 memory. Data should be loaded into and read from each of the blocks in a parallel manner. Both Blocks are simultaneously accesses but
different data can be written / read from each block.
